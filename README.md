## 📖 If You Give a Student a Chromebook...

If you give a student a Chromebook...  
they’ll probably ask for Wi-Fi.  
Once you give them Wi-Fi...  
they’ll ask, *“What’s my login and password again?”*  
And when you help them log in...  
they’ll ask how to find Google Classroom.  
After they open Google Classroom...  
they’ll ask if you know how to submit an assignment.  
And once you show them...  
you’ve officially become their **EdTech Support Specialist**.
